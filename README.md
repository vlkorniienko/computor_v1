# computor_v1
The purpose of this project is to make you code a program that solves simple equations. The program takes a polynomial equation. That is to say, involving only powers, no complicated functions. The program should display its solution(s).

### Mandatory part

Write a program that solves a polynomial equation of degree less than or equal to 2. You will need to display at least:
* The reduced form of the equation.
* The degree of the equation.
* Its solution(s), as well as the sign of the discriminant when it makes sense..

Examples:

It will always be considered that the input is well formatted, ie. all terms are of the form a * x^p. The powers are well ordered and all present.

#### Bonus part
* Manage errors on the input (lexicon and syntax).
* Manage inputs outputs in a natural form.

* Display the solution(s) under the form of irrational fractions when it is interesting..
* Display intermediate steps.
* Display simple form of equation
